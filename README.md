# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Hi my name is Anushka and I'm from the Bay Area. The reason I decided tomajor in GDIM is becasue I've been doing art for a really long and teama dn profoundly enjoyed it and wanted to explore it in a different medium. Furthermore, I love playong games such as League of Legends, Hades, and of course dti in Roblox. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [*] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. Since I don't have experience with programming, I hoping to learn through this class. 
4. Definately nervous about the diffuculty, I feel like it would be easier for those who have experience but since I don't I feel as though I will be spending more time on understanding concepts. 

## Prior Experience

This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers.
